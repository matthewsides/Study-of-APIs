# Study-of-APIs

## API
An Application Programming Interface (API) is a specification intended to be used as an interface by software components to communicate with each other. An API may include specifications for pre-defined subroutines,classes,communication protocols, variables and is an integral tool for the development of software. Essentially because APIs are building blocks for potentional powerful solution capabilities, meaning an API for instance pertianing to the function of adding and subtracting numbers can be applied and imported into software unrelated allowing cross communication between programs and meaning that said programmers no longer have to bother with the logisitics behind or implementation of such a function. However this is dependant on whether the API relates to the specification, functionality and design of the software,thus highlighting the importance of evaluating whether an API is suitable to said scenario. The example of an API that can subtract and add numbers would be usable if for instance the program or application being created was a calculator.
